# Project Roadmap: Multi-Asset VWAP Trend-Following Strategy with Portfolio Optimization

## **1. Project Scope of Work**

### **1.1 Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a **multi-asset trend-following strategy** using **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** as a core indicator. The strategy will incorporate **Supertrend for signal confirmation** and leverage **machine learning for portfolio optimization**. The final model will be backtested and evaluated based on performance metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown**.

### **1.2 Objectives**
- Develop a VWAP-based trend-following strategy for multiple crypto assets.
- Generate trade signals using VWAP crossovers and confirm with Supertrend.
- Optimize portfolio allocation using **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Perform **backtesting** to assess the strategy's effectiveness compared to individual asset strategies.
- Evaluate performance metrics to ensure risk-adjusted returns.

## **2. Technical Requirements**

### **2.1 Tools & Libraries**
- **Data Collection & Processing**: Alpaca API, pandas, NumPy
- **Technical Indicators**: ta (Technical Analysis Library), finta
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Backtesting & Evaluation**: Backtrader, zipline, QuantConnect
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / Google Colab

### **2.2 Environment**
- **Development**: Python 3.10+
- **Trading Data Source**: Alpaca API (Paper Trading)
- **Computational Resources**: Local machine or Google Colab
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository

## **3. Workflow & Timeline**
The project will be divided into **5 phases**, with each phase spanning **one week**.

### **Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation** (Week 1)
- Collect **historical price and volume data** for selected crypto assets using Alpaca API.
- Compute **VWAP** for each asset.
- Preprocess data: handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Define the data structure for modeling.

### **Phase 2: Signal Generation** (Week 2)
- Develop **VWAP-based trade signals** (buy/sell signals based on VWAP crossovers).
- Integrate **Supertrend** for signal confirmation.
- Validate signals using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trade signals for different assets.

### **Phase 3: Portfolio Optimization with Machine Learning** (Week 3)
- Define risk metrics (volatility, drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, correlation matrix).
- Train **ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to allocate portfolio weights based on:
  - Signal strength
  - Risk-adjusted return
  - Asset correlations
- Optimize portfolio allocation and compare different models.

### **Phase 4: Backtesting & Performance Evaluation** (Week 4)
- Implement **backtesting framework** using Backtrader or QuantConnect.
- Compare the **multi-asset strategy vs. individual asset strategies**.
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Sortino Ratio
  - Max Drawdown
  - Profit Factor
- Adjust parameters based on results.

### **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization** (Week 5)
- Document the **entire workflow**:
  - VWAP-based signal generation
  - Portfolio optimization methodology
  - Backtesting results
- Write an **analysis report** on the benefits of using VWAP in a multi-asset strategy.
- Prepare a **GitHub repository** with notebooks and scripts.

## **4. Additional Enhancements for Efficiency**
- **Automate Data Fetching**: Use scheduled scripts to fetch real-time data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilize GridSearchCV or Optuna for tuning ML models.
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multiprocessing for backtesting across multiple assets.
- **Deployment Plan**: If successful, consider running the strategy in a **paper trading** environment for real-world validation.

## **5. Final Deliverables**
- **Codebase**: Jupyter notebooks & scripts for data collection, signal generation, portfolio optimization, and backtesting.
- **Performance Report**: Analysis of strategy effectiveness with key insights.
- **Backtesting Results**: Visualizations and performance comparisons.
- **GitHub Repository**: Organized code and documentation.
